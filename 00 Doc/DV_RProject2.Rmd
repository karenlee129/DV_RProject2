## Procedure for getting our csv data onto Oracle.

#### 1. Require packages.

![](s1.jpg)  

#### 2. Modify R_ETL.R: set working directory and file path, read our csv, use str() to determine which variables are continuous, and change measures accordingly.

#### 3. Run the code to get the SQL CREATE TABLE command. 
#### 4. Use the command to create a table in SQL Developer to create a new table.

#### 5. Open the table, click "Actions," and "Import Data..."

#### 6. Follow through the data import wizard (Match by Position)

#### 7. All data from the csv file data should now be entered into the SQL table you created.

### Data Frame (Red and White Wine)

```{r tidy = TRUE}
source("../01 Data/redwhite.R", echo = TRUE)
```
  
#### Variables
Quality: Wine experts tasted and rated the quality of each wine sample on a scale from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent). 

```{r message = FALSE}
source("../03 Visualizations/whitequalitydistribution.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../03 Visualizations/redqualitydistribution.R", echo = TRUE)
```



## Data Wrangling Visualizations

#### Visualization 1
This visualization shows that there's a negative correlation between density and alcohol levels in white wine. Wine experts seem to prefer lower density and higher alcohol content, as they ranked those wines to be a 6-8 rather than a 3-5 on the scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest quality).

```{r}
source("../02 Data Wrangling/DW_1.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../03 Visualizations/DV_1.R", echo = TRUE)
```
  
  
#### Visualization 2
These box-and-whisker plots indicate that wine experts prefer higher citric acid levels in red wine only. 
Citric acid levels of white wines between all levels of quality had no statistical significance as compared to the positive correlation of quality and citric acid in red wines. 
For white wines, all quality ratings had an average citric acid around 0.3. 
*Black dots represent outliers. The white wine data set is much larger in comparison to red wine, which could be a reason for the excess outliers for the white wine box plot.

```{r}
source("../02 Data Wrangling/DW_2.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../03 Visualizations/DV_2.R", echo = TRUE)
```
  
  
#### Visualition 3
These graphs show that white wine has a wider range of residual sugar levels compared to the residual sugar levels in red wine. 
There is a higher concentration of total sulfur dioxide in white wines.
There is a stark contrast in choloride levels, as indicaded by the color of the points.

```{r}
source("../02 Data Wrangling/DW_3.R", echo = TRUE)
source("../03 Visualizations/DV_3.R", echo = TRUE)
```
